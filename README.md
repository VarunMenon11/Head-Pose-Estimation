# Head-Pose-Estimation
# Head Pose Estimation using MediaPipe and OpenCV 👤📐

## Overview

This repository focuses on implementing Head Pose Estimation using the MediaPipe library in conjunction with OpenCV. Accurately estimating the head pose (yaw, pitch, and roll) is essential in computer vision applications, especially those involving human-computer interaction.

## Features 🚀

- Utilizes MediaPipe for robust facial landmark detection.
- Implements OpenCV for image processing and visualization.
- Estimates head pose angles (yaw, pitch, roll) for a given face.

## Requirements 🛠️

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

Install the necessary dependencies using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
```

## How to Use 🤖

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/head-pose-estimation.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd head-pose-estimation
```

3. Run the main script:

```bash
python head_pose_estimation.py
```
